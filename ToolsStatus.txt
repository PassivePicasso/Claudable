# Claudable Tool System Implementation Log

## Focus
Creating a system in Claudable that enables React/TSX components created in Claude conversations to be cached locally and run as standalone tools within Claudable, preserving their full functionality including imports, dependencies, and styling.

## Status
- Basic infrastructure is in place (Tool model, ToolManager, ToolWindow)
- Can create and store tools locally
- UI for managing tools exists
- Initial attempts at rendering tools are encountering module/import issues
- Current blocker is properly handling module imports in the WebView2 environment

## Goals
1. Allow TSX components created in Claude to be saved as reusable tools
2. Launch tools in separate windows using WebView2
3. Support full React functionality including:
   - Module imports/exports
   - React hooks
   - Lucide icons
   - Tailwind styling
   - shadcn/ui components
4. Maintain component portability without modification
5. Enable tool state persistence
6. Support communication between tools and Claudable

## Current Issues
Need to identify again

## Key Files
- ToolWindow.xaml and ToolWindow.xaml.cs - WebView2 host for tools
- Tool.cs - Model for cached tools
- ToolManager.cs - Service managing tool storage/loading
- Tools tab in MainWindow.xaml
- ToolViewModel.cs - To be described

## Implementation Notes
- Tools are stored as JSON files with UUID identifiers
- Using WebView2 for rendering
- Need to maintain compatibility with Claude's React component system
- Must support the same libraries available in Claude's environment

This is a core feature for Claudable that enables reuse of components created in Claude conversations as standalone tools within the application.
