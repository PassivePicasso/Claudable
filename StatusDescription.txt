We have developed a WPF application called "File Monitor" with two main components:

1. Download Monitor:
   - Watches the user's Downloads folder for new files
   - Displays files in a ListBox with original and PascalCase filenames
   - Allows moving and renaming files to a selected destination folder
   - Provides functionality to delete selected files

2. File Change Monitor:
   - Monitors a user-selected folder for file changes (creations, modifications, renames)
   - Displays changed files in a ListBox with filenames and last modified times
   - Supports drag-and-drop functionality to copy files to other applications
   - Removes dragged files from the ListBox but keeps original files intact
   - Allows opening files with a double-click

The application uses a two-column layout, displaying both monitors side-by-side for easy comparison and management. Key features include:

- FileSystemWatcher for real-time file monitoring
- Custom file renaming to PascalCase
- Drag-and-drop support with Windows API
- File operations (move, rename, delete)

The application is built using C# and XAML, with the main logic in MainWindow.xaml.cs and the UI defined in MainWindow.xaml.

In our next chat, we can discuss potential improvements, additional features, or any specific aspects of the application you'd like to modify or expand upon.
